## F.R.I.D.A.Y. - AI -Assistant for PC
Taking inspiration from Alexa , Siri and Cortana I wanted an AI Assistant for myself , loaded with features that handles my day-to-day or repetitive work. I wanted it to be more than just a normal bot thus , this AI-Assistant has been customized with a deep learning model i.e. it has its own brain (neural network) to converse with a human being accordingly and be as user friendly as possible.

## Features

- In speak.py I have designed the ability to speak for my AI Assistant
- Listen.py takes care of speech recognition.
- The combination of brain.py, NN.py and layers.py help with the neural network where the model has been trained and as for data to train on a conversation format in the form of intents.json was provided
- Following are the tasks that have been created that are possible by this AI Assistant:
    
    - Tell Time, Date or Day
    - Open Applications such as:
        
        - Discord
        - Powerpoint
        - Excel
        - Google Chrome etc.
    - Take screenshot/snip
    - Play desired music from Spotify
    - Plot route on maps by taking in desired locations
    - Set an alarm
    - Take in notes as reminders
    - Conduct Internet Speed Test
    - Ability to search on Wikipedia
    - Google stuff according to user
    - Send an email
    - Give Current Weather Details
- Lastly , I wanted to add a security feature that is a FaceID where only after user recognition this program can be run. The FaceID project can be found [here](https://github.com/TejasARathod/FaceID-APP). 
## Tech Stack

**Language Used:** Python

**IDE Used:** VS Code


## Deployement

To deploy this project either you will have to train the Face ID part for yourself or remove it completely.
Link for the FaceID has been given above.

Through terminal: 

```bash
  python Friday.py
```
OR I would simply recommend to use Visual Studio Code for simplicity.
